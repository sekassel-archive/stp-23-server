# Asynchronous WebSocket

The asynchronous WebSocket is available under the `/ws/${environment.version}/events` path.
It accepts incoming commands and sends outgoing events.
To receive events, you first need to subscribe to them.

## Authentication

To connect to the WebSocket, you need to authenticate yourself using a JWT.
You can pass the token either via `Authorization: Bearer <Token>` header,
or using the query parameter `authHeader` in the endpoint URL.
Failing to provide a (valid) token will cause the WebSocket to disconnect automatically.

## Commands

The WebSocket supports the following commands:

| Command       | Payload                |
|---------------|------------------------|
| `subscribe`   | Event Pattern (string) |
| `unsubscribe` | Event Pattern (string) |

Commands are sent as JSON, for example:

```json
{"event":"subscribe","data":"users.*.*"}
```

## Events

Events are subscribed to and unsubscribed from using the commands described above.
Each event has a qualified name consisting of one or segments separated by periods (`.`).
You can subscribe to multiple events using qualified names or wildcard patterns, as shown by the following example patterns:

* `users.507f191e810c19729de860ea.created`
  * Matches: `users.507f191e810c19729de860ea.created`
  * Does not match: `users.507f191e810c19729de860ea.updated`, `groups.507f191e810c19729de860ea.created`, `users.60bfe4dff98fef16e696ce6c.created`
* `users.*.created`
  * Matches: `users.507f191e810c19729de860ea.created`, `users.60bfe4dff98fef16e696ce6c.created`
  * Does not match: `users.507f191e810c19729de860ea.updated`, `groups.507f191e810c19729de860ea.created`
* `users.507f191e810c19729de860ea.*`
  * Matches: `users.507f191e810c19729de860ea.created`, `users.507f191e810c19729de860ea.updated`, `users.507f191e810c19729de860ea.deleted`
  * Does not match: `groups.507f191e810c19729de860ea.updated`, `users.60bfe4dff98fef16e696ce6c.deleted`
* `users.*.*`
  * Matches: `users.507f191e810c19729de860ea.created`, `users.60bfe4dff98fef16e696ce6c.updated`, `users.507f191e810c19729de860ea.deleted`, `users.60bfe4dff98fef16e696ce6c.deleted`
  * Does not match: `groups.507f191e810c19729de860ea.updated`

You receive events from the moment you send the `subscribe` command, up until you send the `unsubscribe` command *with the exact same pattern*.
That means it is **not** possible to
a) subscribe with a wilcard pattern and selectively unsubscribe with a more specific pattern, or
b) subscribe with one or more specific pattern and unsubscribe with a wildcard pattern.

All events are automatically unsubscribed when closing the WebSocket connection.

Similar to commands, events are sent as JSON.
However, the payload within the `data` field may contain any JSON value, not just strings.

```json
{"event":"groups.507f191e810c19729de860ea.created","data":{"_id": "507f191e810c19729de860ea", "...": "..."}}
```

The following table shows which events may be sent.
Some events are only visible to certain users for privacy reasons.

<sup>1</sup>: The shorthand notation `foo.{bar,baz}` means "either `foo.bar` or `foo.baz`" **in this table**. You **cannot** use this notation to subscribe to or unsubscribe from events!

<sup>2</sup>:
The placeholder `<userId>` stands for "some fixed User ID". For example, a possible event could be `users.507f191e810c19729de860ea.updated`.
You can use this to subscribe to events that concern a single resource. If you do want to subscribe to all user events, use the pattern `users.*.*`.
Similarly, to receive all events regarding the messages of a group, you could use the pattern `groups.507f191e810c19729de860ea.messages.*.*`.
