# Asynchronous UDP Socket

The asynchronous UDP socket is available under the `${environment.udpAddress}` address.
It accepts incoming commands and sends outgoing events.
To receive events, you first need to subscribe to them.

## Limitations and Important Notes

Neither subscription nor event delivery is guaranteed due to limitations of UDP.
The maximum safe message size is 508 bytes (see [1]).

The number of event patters that can be subscribed to is limited to **${environment.rateLimit.udpSubscriptionLimit}**.
Wildcard subscriptions count as one subscription.

UDP clients that do not send a command are disconnected after **${environment.cleanup.udpLifetimeMinutes}** minutes.
The `ping` command can be used to keep the connection alive.

## Commands

The UDP Socket supports the following commands:

| Command                                      | Payload                                   |
|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `ping`                                       | Optional, Ignored                         |
| `subscribe`                                  | Event Pattern (string)                    |
| `unsubscribe`                                | Event Pattern (string)                    |
| `areas.<areaId>.trainers.<trainerId>.moved`  | [`MoveTrainerDto`](#model-MoveTrainerDto) |
| `areas.<areaId>.trainers.<trainerId>.talked` | [`TalkTrainerDto`](#model-TalkTrainerDto) |

Commands are sent as JSON, for example:

```json
{"event":"subscribe","data":"users.*.*"}
```

```json
{
  "event": "areas.507f191e810c19729de860ea.trainers.507f191e810c19729de860ea.moved",
  "data": {
    "_id": "507f191e810c19729de860ea",
    "area": "507f191e810c19729de860ea",
    "x": 10,
    "y": 20,
    "direction": 1
  }
}
```

If a command is invalid, the socket will send an `error` event (see below).

## Events

See the WebSocket documentation for general information about events.

The following table shows which events may be sent.
Some events are only visible to certain users for privacy reasons.

| Event Name                                  | Payload                                                                                                            | Visible to                       |
|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `pong`                                      | Nothing                                                                                                            | Sender of the `ping` command     |
| `areas.<areaId>.trainers.<trainerId>.moved` | [`MoveTrainerDto`](#model-MoveTrainerDto)                                                                          | Everyone                         |
| `error`                                     | `string` or [`ErrorResponse`](#model-ErrorResponse) or [`ValidationErrorResponse`](#model-ValidationErrorResponse) | The socket that caused the error |
